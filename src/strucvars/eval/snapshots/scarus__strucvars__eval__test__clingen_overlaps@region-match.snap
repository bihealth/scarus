    functionDescription:
      - "FUNCTION: Transcriptional regulator that plays a role in chondrocytes differentiation and skeletal development (PubMed:24038782). Binds to the COL2A1 promoter and activates COL2A1 expression, as part of a complex with ZNF219 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q04887, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24038782}."
    diseaseDescription:
      - "DISEASE: Campomelic dysplasia (CMD1) [MIM:114290]: A rare, often lethal, osteochondrodysplasia characterized by congenital bowing and angulation of long bones. Other skeletal defects include unusually small scapula, deformed pelvis and spine, and a missing pair of ribs. Craniofacial and ear defects are common. Most patients die soon after birth due to respiratory distress which has been attributed to hypoplasia of the tracheobronchial cartilage and small thoracic cage. Up to two-thirds of affected XY individuals have genital defects or may develop as phenotypic females. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10446171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10951468, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11323423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11754051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12783851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19033726, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19921652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20513132, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24038782, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7485151, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9002675, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452059}.

    summary: "The protein encoded by this gene recognizes the sequence CCTTGAG along with other members of the HMG-box class DNA-binding proteins. It acts during chondrocyte differentiation and, with steroidogenic factor 1, regulates transcription of the anti-Muellerian hormone (AMH) gene. Deficiencies lead to the skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia, frequently with sex reversal. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]"

    diseaseDescription:
      - "DISEASE: Congenital disorder of glycosylation 2G (CDG2G) [MIM:611209]: A multisystem disorder caused by a defect in glycoprotein biosynthesis and characterized by under-glycosylated serum glycoproteins. Congenital disorders of glycosylation result in a wide variety of clinical features, such as defects in the nervous system development, psychomotor retardation, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, coagulation disorders, and immunodeficiency. The broad spectrum of features reflects the critical role of N- glycoproteins during embryonic development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell functions. Clinical features of CDG2G include failure to thrive, generalized hypotonia, growth retardation and mild psychomotor retardation. CDG2G is biochemically characterized by a defect in O-glycosylation as well as N-glycosylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16537452}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry."

    summary: "The protein encoded by this gene is one of eight proteins (Cog1-8) which form a Golgi-localized complex (COG) required for normal Golgi morphology and function. It is thought that this protein is required for steps in the normal medial and trans Golgi-associated processing of glycoconjugates and plays a role in the organization of the Golgi-localized complex.
